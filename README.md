# AlexTTS

AlexTTS is a passion projectâ€” a text-to-speech model built from the ground up. I wanted to understand, at a low level, what an end-to-end deep learning project **really** means. While I've had some experience with autoregressive text generation models, it was primarily limited to fine-tuning pre-existing architectures. I had the privilege of speaking with [Eli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elipugh), an ML researcher at [Cartesia](https://cartesia.ai/). Our conversation left me with a single, compelling thought:

> Why not build my own unique text-to-speech model?

See my [blog](https://itisalex2.github.io/AlexTTS) for more information! My files are stored in `apps/tts`.
